  <h1>What is the Code for San Francisco Brigade?</h1>

  <p>We are a Code for America Brigade, which means we're volunteers that contribute our talents toward improving the way our local governments and community organizations use the web. Brigade is about action and you're here because you are someone who takes action.</p>
